# ttbar_threshold
A complete physics analysis pipeline for top quark pair production using deep learning. Processes ROOT files, performs 4-vector calculations, extracts 13 physics features, and trains a binary DNN classifier to distinguish signal vs background events with ~60% accuracy. Includes Monte Carlo weighting and feature importance analysis.
